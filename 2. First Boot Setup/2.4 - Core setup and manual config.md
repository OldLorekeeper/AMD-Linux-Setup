This section is divided into two parts. First, you will run the main automated script, which handles the vast majority of setup. Second, you will perform a few manual steps that cannot be automated.

## 2.4.1 - Automated script

The script below automates the entire core system setup, including:

- Optimising `/etc/makepkg.conf` for native compilation.
    
- Updating the mirror list.
    
- Installing the `yay` AUR helper.
    
- Installing all common packages from `core_pkg.txt`.
    
- Enabling core system services.
    
- Automating most of the miscellaneous steps from the previous guide (locales, environment variables, zram, pacman hooks, Bluetooth, KRunner icon, Gemini plasmoid, etc.).
    

Run the following command:

```
chmod +x ~/Obsidian/AMD-Linux-Setup/Scripts/core_setup.sh && ~/Obsidian/AMD-Linux-Setup/Scripts/core_setup.sh
```

The script will run for several minutes. At the end, it will automatically restart your Plasma shell to apply changes. After it finishes, proceed with the manual steps below.

## 2.4.2 - Manual config

The `core_setup.sh` script automated most of the setup. The steps below are the only ones that must be completed manually.

### 2.4.2.1 - Setup Obsidian

This step requires logging in with your Personal Access Token (PAT).

```
git config --global credential.helper libsecret
```

```
cd ~/Obsidian
```

```
git clone https://github.com/OldLorekeeper/[Insert_repo_here]

> Enter username
> Enter PAT
```

```
git config --global user.email "[user_email]"
```

Open Obsidian and select the cloned repo folder as your existing vault.

### 2.4.2.2 - Delay Steam autostart and launch in system tray only

The `core_setup.sh` script already created the `~/Make/steam-delay.sh` file. You just need to add it to your KDE Autostart settings.

1. Open System Settings and go to `Autostart`.
    
2. Click `Add new...` > `Application...`.
    
3. Go to the `Games` tab, select `Steam`, and click `OK`.
    
4. Find the new Steam entry, click its `properties` (menu button on the right).
    
5. Select the `Application` tab.
    
6. Change the `Program:` field to: `~/Make/steam-delay.sh`
    
7. Ensure `Arguments:` is: `%U`
