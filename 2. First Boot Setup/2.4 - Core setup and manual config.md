## 2.4.1 - Automated script

Run the following command:

```
chmod +x ~/Obsidian/AMD-Linux-Setup/Scripts/core_setup.sh && ~/Obsidian/AMD-Linux-Setup/Scripts/core_setup.sh
```

The script automates the entire core system setup, including:

- Optimising `/etc/makepkg.conf` for native compilation.This section is divided into two parts. First, you will run the main automated script, which handles the vast majority of setup. Second, you will perform a few manual steps that cannot be automated.
    
- Updating the mirror list.
    
- Installing the `yay` AUR helper.
    
- Installing all common packages from `core_pkg.txt`.
    
- Enabling core system services.
    
- Automating most of the miscellaneous steps from the previous guide (locales, environment variables, zram, pacman hooks, Bluetooth, KRunner icon, Gemini plasmoid, etc.).
    

The script will run for several minutes. At the end, it will automatically restart your Plasma shell to apply changes. After it finishes, proceed with the manual steps below.

### 2.4.2.2 - Delay Steam autostart and launch in system tray only

The `core_setup.sh` script already created the `~/Make/steam-delay.sh` file. You just need to add it to your KDE Autostart settings.

1. Open System Settings and go to `Autostart`.
    
2. Click `Add new...` > `Application...`.
    
3. Go to the `Games` tab, select `Steam`, and click `OK`.
    
4. Find the new Steam entry, click its `properties` (menu button on the right).
    
5. Select the `Application` tab.
    
6. Change the `Program:` field to: `~/Make/steam-delay.sh`
    
7. Ensure `Arguments:` is: `%U`
