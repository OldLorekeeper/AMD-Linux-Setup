https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token

Open Obsidian and select the cloned AMD-Linux-Setup repo folder (or any other folder) as an existing vault.

Note: May need to manually reinstall Git community plugin from settings (home_script should have automated credentials)

## 2.2.2 - Delay Steam autostart and launch in system tray only

Note: Only necessary if Steam autostart does not function as intended

The `core_setup.sh` script already created the `~/Make/steam-delay.sh` file. You just need to add it to your KDE Autostart settings.

1. Open System Settings and go to `Autostart`.
2. Click `Add new...` > `Application...`.
3. Go to the `Games` tab, select `Steam`, and click `OK`.
4. Find the new Steam entry, click its `properties` (menu button on the right).
5. Select the `Application` tab.
6. Change the `Program:` field to: `~/Make/steam-delay.sh`
7. Ensure `Arguments:` is: `%U`
