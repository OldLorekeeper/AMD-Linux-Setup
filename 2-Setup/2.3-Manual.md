## 2.3.2 - Delay Steam autostart and launch in system tray only

Note: Only necessary if Steam autostart does not function as intended

The `core_setup.sh` script already created the `~/Make/steam-delay.sh` file. You just need to add it to your KDE Autostart settings.

1. Open System Settings and go to `Autostart`.
2. Click `Add new...` > `Application...`.
3. Go to the `Games` tab, select `Steam`, and click `OK`.
4. Find the new Steam entry, click its `properties` (menu button on the right).
5. Select the `Application` tab.
6. Change the `Program:` field to: `~/Make/steam-delay.sh`
7. Ensure `Arguments:` is: `%U`
