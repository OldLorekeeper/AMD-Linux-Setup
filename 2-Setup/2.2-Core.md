## Automated script

Run the following command:

```
chmod +x ~/Obsidian/AMD-Linux-Setup/Scripts/core_setup.sh && ~/Obsidian/AMD-Linux-Setup/Scripts/core_setup.sh
```

The script automates the entire core system setup, including:

- Optimising `/etc/makepkg.conf` for native compilation.
- Updating the mirror list.
- Installing the `yay` AUR helper.
- Installing all common packages from `core_pkg.txt`.
- Enabling core system services.
- Automating other miscellaneous steps 

The script will run for several minutes. At the end, it will automatically restart your Plasma shell to apply changes. After it finishes, proceed with the manual steps below.
