## 1.2.1 - Set keyboard locale

```
loadkeys uk
```

<br/>

## 1.2.2 - Connect to WiFi

```
iwctl --passphrase [password] station wlan0 connect [SSID]
```

<br/>

## 1.2.3 - Run install script

This monolithic script handles partitioning, formatting, package installation, and system configuration.

**Important:** Do not run this command via a pipe (`| zsh`) as it requires interactive user input. Use the process substitution method below:

```
zsh <(curl -Ls https://smplu.link/cctFs)
```

### Script Workflow & Inputs

The script is interactive. Be ready to provide the following information when prompted:

1. **Secrets Decryption:**
    
    - The script attempts to download `setup_secrets.enc`. If found, you will be asked for the decryption password.
        
    - _Fallback:_ If decryption fails or the file is missing, you must manually enter passwords (Root, User) and credentials (Git PAT, Soulseek) in the subsequent steps.
        
2. **User Configuration:**
    
    - **Hostname:** Defaults to `NCC-1701`.
        
    - **Username:** Defaults to `user`.
        
    - **Git Config:** Name, Email, and **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**. _Note: A PAT is required to clone private dotfiles._
        
3. **Device Profile:**
    
    - Select **1** for Desktop (Ryzen 7800X3D / RX 7900 XT).
        
    - Select **2** for Laptop (Ryzen 7840HS / 780M).
        
4. **Desktop Specifics (Profile 1 Only):**
    
    - **Media Drive:** You may enter a UUID to mount an existing media partition to `/mnt/Media`.
        
    - **Services:** Input credentials for Slskd and Soulseek (if not loaded via secrets).
        
    - **Headless/EDID:** Option to inject a custom 2560x1600 EDID for headless streaming. You may need to specify the target port (e.g., `DP-1`).
        
5. **Disk Selection:**
    
    - The script lists available drives (e.g., `nvme0n1`).
        
    - **Warning:** The selected disk will be completely wiped. You must type `yes` to confirm execution.

<br/>
 
## 1.2.4 - Reboot

Once the script prints "System ready," reboot the machine:

```
reboot
```

**First Boot:** Upon logging in, a terminal window will automatically launch to finalize setup (applying Konsave profiles, Sunshine configuration, and KWin rules). Do not close this window until it notifies you that setup is complete.
