## 1.2.1 - Connect to WiFi

```
iwctl --passphrase [password] station wlan0 connect [SSID]
```

<br/>

## 1.2.2 - Run unified install script

The script will handle partitioning, user creation, and base installation.

```
zsh <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OldLorekeeper/AMD-Linux-Setup/main/Scripts/setup_install.zsh)
```

**Workflow:**

- User Configuration: Enter hostname, user/root passwords, and optional Git credentials.
- Profile Selection: Choose Desktop (Ryzen 7800X3D) or Laptop (Ryzen 7840HS).
- Disk Selection: Select and wipes the target NVMe drive.
- Execution: The script will run for several minutes.

<br/>
 
## 1.2.3 - Reboot

Once the script completes:

```
reboot
```

Upon logging in for the first time, a terminal window will open automatically to finalize the device setup (Konsave profiles, Sunshine configuration, etc.).
