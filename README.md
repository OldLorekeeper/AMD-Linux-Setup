# AMD Linux Setup

This repository contains my personal setup scripts and configurations for installing and configuring Arch Linux on my all-AMD desktop and laptop. The scripts and settings are tailored to my specific hardware and preferences, aiming to streamline the installation and post-installation process.
## Purpose

- Automates parts of the Arch Linux installation process.
    
- Configures the system for optimal performance on AMD hardware.
    
- Sets up key software and tools that I use regularly.
    

## Compatibility

- Designed for **AMD** CPUs and GPUs.
    
- Specifically tested on **my desktop and laptop**.
    
- May not be suitable for other hardware setups without modification.
    

## Usage

This repository is **intended for personal use**. However, others are welcome to explore the scripts and adapt them for their own systems. Be sure to review and modify configurations as needed to match your own hardware and preferences.

### Notes

- Some scripts assume a clean Arch Linux install following the official Arch Wiki guidelines.
    
- The configurations may include personal preferences that may not be optimal for all users.
    
- Ensure you understand the scripts before running them to avoid unintended changes to your system.
