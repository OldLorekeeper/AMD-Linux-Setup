# AMD Linux Setup

This repository contains my personal setup scripts and configurations for installing and configuring Arch Linux on my all-AMD desktop and laptop. The scripts and settings are tailored to my specific hardware and preferences, aiming to streamline the installation and post-installation process.

- Sets up key software and tools that I use regularly.
    

## Compatibility

- Designed for **AMD** CPUs and GPUs.
    
- Specifically tested on **my desktop and laptop**.

## Usage

This repository is **intended for personal use**. However, others are welcome to explore the scripts and adapt them for their own systems. Be sure to review and modify configurations as needed to match your own hardware and preferences.
