## Desktop and Laptop App Sizes

Window rules for certain app sizes are set during setup by `kwin_apply_rules.zsh`

Common values can be changed in terminal by running `edit-kwin` and `update-kwin`, but you must change sizes by updating the Desktop and Laptop templates in the [Window-Rules](../5-Resources/Window-Rules/) folder.

## Other Rules

You may need to add these additional Window rules if you notice any issues with OpenGL displaying in dock or PiP not working as intended.

Hide OpenGL renderer

```
> Window class (application) > Unimportant
> Match whole window class > ☐ Yes ☑ No
> Window types: Normal windows
> Window title > Exact Match > OpenGL Renderer
> Skip taskbar > Apply initially > ☑ Yes ☐ No
```

PiP Above

```
> Window class (application) > Unimportant
> Match whole window class > ☐ Yes ☑ No
> Window types: All selected
> Window title > Exact Match > Picture-in-picture
> Keep above other windows > Force > ☑ Yes ☐ No
```
